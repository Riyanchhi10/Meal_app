**The Meal App**
____________________

A meal app is created to store and search meals. ONLY vanilla javascript is used , no libraries or frameworks used for Javascript .



______________________
**Key Features**
_________________

**Home Page**
Search any meal from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions).
Each search result of the meal should have a favourite button, clicking on which the meal should be added to “My favourite meals” (a list).
On clicking any particular search result (any meal), open a new page with more information about that meal(meal page)

**Meal Detail Page**
Should show information about the meal like its name, photo, instructions, etc (these are must, rest you can add if you want).

**My favourite meals Page**
Display a list of all the favourite meals.
Make this list persistent (should have the same number of meals before and after closing the browser/refreshing the browser).
Remove from favourites button: Each meal should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that meal from the list.
